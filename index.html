    #Freight_Lane_Groups<br><br>

    As a data science consultant at a third-party logistics startup, I created an application that clarified an annual bidding process. The business submitted annual bids for a few thousand routes spanning hundreds of major US cities.<br><br>

    My application identified groupings of 10-20 routes that could be priced on the same level in our pricing model. On my own time, I pushed the model to cluster five-thousand routes using the OPTICS algorithm, and I added functionalities that allow you to visualize the primary arteries in a logistics network. The application returns the following types of files.<br>

    A map of a simple random sample of 200 / 5,000 routes.<br>
    <a href="routes.html">routes</a><br><br>

    A map of the routes grouped together. Each line represents a group of 10-20 routes.<br>
    <a href="route_groups.html">route_groups</a><br><br>

    A map of the route groups with color. Each color represents a hub where route groups connect. 
    <a href="route_groups_color_0.html">route_groups_color_0</a><br>
    <a href="route_groups_color_1.html">route_groups_color_1</a><br>
    <a href="route_groups_color_2.html">route_groups_color_2</a><br>

    A map of the route groupings. Each hub is assigned a color.
    A map of hubs connected by many routes flowing back-and-forth between them.
    Larger circles represent higher importance.
    Thicker connections represent more routes.
    <a href="hubs.html">hubs</a><br><br>

    In summary, the OPTICS implementation allows us to group together lanes for purposes of pricing or bidding.
    The PageRank implementation allows us to focus on the most important hubs and the route clusters connecting them.

    In Addition, the route groups can be used to create pricing zones.

    A map of the price zones. Each pair of shapes represents a price zone.
    <a href="pricing_zone_0.html">pricing_zone_0</a><br>
    <a href="pricing_zone_1.html">pricing_zone_1</a><br>
    <a href="pricing_zone_2.html">pricing_zone_2</a><br>
    <a href="pricing_zone_3.html">pricing_zone_3</a><br>
    <a href="pricing_zone_4.html">pricing_zone_4</a><br><br>

    The final graph shows the distance that OPTICS travelled to reach each subsequent route.
    Dips in the graph represent routes that are close together compared to other routes in the region.
    The colors in pricing_zone_0.html correspond to the colors in reachability_0.png.
